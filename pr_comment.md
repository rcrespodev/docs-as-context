## üêõ Bug Fix: Navigation between Nested Stacks in Expo Router

### Problem
During the development of the MedTrack application, we identified a critical issue with navigation between nested routes in Expo Router. Back buttons were not functioning correctly when navigating between different sections of the application (tasks ‚Üí treatments, tasks ‚Üí health-records, etc.).

### Symptoms
- **Headers duplicados**: Multiple navigation bars were stacked
- **Botones de retroceso no funcionales**: The native "back" button did not appear or function correctly

### Root Cause
Each folder with its own `_layout.tsx` containing a `<Stack>` created an **independent navigation stack**. When navigating between routes from different stacks, Expo Router could not maintain a coherent history, resulting in:
- Multiple stacked stacks
- Non-functional back buttons
- Unpredictable navigation behavior

### Solution
Implemented a unified stack structure and relative navigation patterns to maintain coherent navigation history within the same stack context.

### Changes Made
- **Unified main stack**: Consolidated all routes in `home/_layout.tsx`
- **Removed nested stacks**: Eliminated `<Stack>` wrappers from subdirectory layouts
- **Implemented relative navigation**: Used stack-relative routes starting with `/home/`
- **Fixed TabNavigator**: Removed duplicate route definitions causing "extraneous routes" warnings

### Files Modified
- `home/_layout.tsx` - Unified stack configuration
- `home/treatments/[id]/_layout.tsx` - Removed Stack wrapper
- `components/custom/task/task-navigation.tsx` - Updated navigation patterns
- `TabNavigator.tsx` - Cleaned up route definitions

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Relative Navigation**: Used `/home/` prefixed routes instead of absolute paths
- **Single Stack Architecture**: Eliminated multiple independent stacks
- **Route Consolidation**: Defined all routes in the main stack layout

### Testing
- [x] Manual testing completed
- [x] Navigation flow verified between all sections
- [x] Back button functionality tested
- [x] TabNavigator warnings resolved
- [ ] Push notification navigation (pending test)

### Additional Notes
- This solution follows Expo Router best practices for nested navigators
- The implementation maintains backward compatibility
- Performance impact is minimal as we're reducing stack complexity
- Documentation has been updated with navigation patterns for future reference

### Breaking Changes
None - this is a bug fix that maintains existing API and functionality.
